# Create a Test File to Find Correct Path

## In DreamHost File Manager:

1. Go to `/home/site56social/` (where you just moved the files)

2. Create a new file called `test.html` with this content:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Test</title></head>
<body>
<h1>TEST - Site is Working!</h1>
<p>If you can see this, files are in the right place.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

3. Save it in the same directory where you put index.html

4. Try accessing: http://vps27305.dreamhostps.com/~site56social/test.html

## Alternative: The files might need to be in a different location

Check if any of these folders exist:
- `/home/site56social/public_html/`
- `/home/site56social/56social.com/`
- `/home/site56social/www/`

If any of these exist, that's where your files should go!

## Current File Location Check:
Your files should now be in `/home/site56social/` with this structure:
```
/home/site56social/
├── index.html     <-- Your homepage
├── 404.html
├── robots.txt
├── sitemap.xml
├── _next/         <-- Folder with JS/CSS
├── images/        <-- Folder with images
├── 404/           <-- Folder
└── (other existing folders like .cache, logs, etc)
```

Make sure `index.html` is directly in `/home/site56social/` not in a subfolder!
