# Your Site URLs

## Try These URLs:

### 1. Direct Server URL (Should Work Now):
```
http://vps27305.dreamhostps.com/~site56social/
```

### 2. Domain URLs (Once DNS is set up):
```
http://56social.com
https://56social.com
```

## Notes:
- The `56social.dreamhosters.com` domain doesn't exist - that's why you get DNS error
- Use the direct server URL above - it should work immediately
- The `56social.com` domain will work once DNS propagates (can take 4-48 hours)

## Where You Uploaded Files:
You uploaded to the correct place if the files are in:
- The `56social.com` folder on DreamHost
- OR the `public_html` folder
- OR the main folder for site56social user

## If Site Not Loading:
1. Check that files are in the right folder
2. Make sure `.htaccess` file was uploaded
3. Try adding `/index.html` to the URL
4. Clear your browser cache

## Test These Now:
1. http://vps27305.dreamhostps.com/~site56social/
2. http://vps27305.dreamhostps.com/~site56social/index.html
