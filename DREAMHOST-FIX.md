# DreamHost Deployment - Alternative Methods

## The Issue
SSH/SFTP authentication is failing. This is likely because:
1. SSH was just enabled and needs more time to activate (can take up to 30 minutes)
2. The password might need to be reset

## Immediate Solutions

### Solution 1: Reset Password in DreamHost Panel
1. Go to DreamHost Panel > Manage Users (or FTP Users)
2. Find user: `site56social`
3. Click "Edit" 
4. Set a new password (keep it simple, no special characters for now)
5. Save and wait 5 minutes
6. Try FileZilla again with new password

### Solution 2: Use DreamHost WebFTP (Built-in)
1. Go to DreamHost Panel
2. Look for "WebFTP" or "File Manager" 
3. It should let you browse without SFTP
4. Upload files directly through the web interface

### Solution 3: Contact DreamHost Support (Fastest)
1. Go to DreamHost Panel
2. Click "Contact Support" or chat icon
3. Say: "I just created a new hosting account for site56social but SFTP authentication is failing"
4. They can fix it immediately

### Solution 4: Create FTP-only User
1. DreamHost Panel > FTP Users
2. Create new FTP user (not SFTP)
3. Regular FTP often works when SFTP doesn't
4. Use FileZilla with:
   - Protocol: FTP (not SFTP)
   - Port: 21 (not 22)

## What to Upload
Once you can connect, upload everything from:
`/Users/halpickus/Documents/Projects/56-social-nextjs-premium/out/`

To the DreamHost folder:
`56social.dreamhosters.com/` or `56social.com/`

## Quick Test Commands
Try these in Terminal to see what's happening:

```bash
# Test if server is reachable
ping vps27305.dreamhostps.com

# Test if SSH port is open
nc -zv vps27305.dreamhostps.com 22

# Test if FTP port is open  
nc -zv vps27305.dreamhostps.com 21
```

## If Nothing Works
The site is built and ready in the `out` folder. You can:
1. Wait 30 minutes for SSH to fully activate
2. Contact DreamHost support (they respond quickly)
3. Try again tomorrow (sometimes takes overnight)

The files are ready - we just need to get them uploaded!
